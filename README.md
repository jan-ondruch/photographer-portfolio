# encantada-photo

Goal of this project was to create a custom photography portfolio from scratch using pure HTML5, SASS and basic JS (jQuery); to try a new concept of a website, more artistic and creative.<br><br>

### To run locally
`gulp serve`

## Project status
Project status: 90%.<br><br>

### What is missing:
Better responsivity.<br> 
Functional contact form.<br>
Replace fake info with a real one (in case the project is used for real purposes).

## What have I learned:
How to create multiple slideshows.<br>
More of jQuery, SASS and Gulp.<br>
Generating project with Yeoman.<br>
That even with a smaller project like this consisting of few pages,<br>
correcting some navbar information can be quite annoying -> better to 
use some templating system (EJS, Mustache, Jade...).<br>
Minimalistic design.

## For distribution
Use the manual_dist folder, since gulp serve:dist does not work properly.
WARNING! index.html in dev is different than in the manual_dist folder!!!
				 (if you change it, be aware the versions are different... (links in them))
