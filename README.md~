Run:
gulp serve

For distribution, use the manual_dist folder, since gulp serve:dist
does not work properly.

Project status: 80%.
What is missing: better responsivity, non-repetitive images, functional
contact form.

What have I learned:
How to create multiple slideshows.
More of jQuery, SASS and Gulp.
Generating project with Yeoman.
That even with a smaller project like this consisting of few pages,
correcting some navbar information can be quite annoying -> better to 
use some templating system (EJS, Mustache, Jade...).
Minimalistic design.
