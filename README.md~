Run:
gulp serve

Deployment:
http://encantada-photo.surge.sh/

Goal of the project:
Create a custom photography portfolio from scratch using pure HTML5, SASS and basic JS (jQuery).
Try a new concept of a website, more artistic and creative.

For distribution:
use the manual_dist folder, since gulp serve:dist does not work properly.
WARNING! index.html in dev is different than in the manual_dist folder!!!
				 (if you change it, be aware the versions are different... (links in them))

Project status: 90%.

What is missing:
better responsivity. 
Functional contact form.
Replace fake info with a real one (in case the project is used for real purposes).

What have I learned:
How to create multiple slideshows.
More of jQuery, SASS and Gulp.
Generating project with Yeoman.
That even with a smaller project like this consisting of few pages,
correcting some navbar information can be quite annoying -> better to 
use some templating system (EJS, Mustache, Jade...).
Minimalistic design.
